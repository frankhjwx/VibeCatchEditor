# FruitsAtelier

[简体中文](README.md) | **English**

An independent osu!catch beatmap editor for Windows and macOS. Edit fruits and FSliders on a time–X canvas and preview Catch objects alongside the music.

The project is under active development.

## Features

- Open `.osz` archives, v14 / Mode=2 `.osu` beatmaps, and `.catchproj` projects.
- Edit fruits, FSliders, and banana showers with beat snapping, multi-selection, group movement, cut/copy, and undo/redo.
- Convert imported Legacy Sliders into editable FSliders, then adjust anchors, Bézier handles, and span counts.
- Play MP3 / OGG / WAV audio and seek using the timeline. Preview objects with AR, CS, and Catch skins.
- Save `.catchproj` projects or export `.osu` beatmaps. Project files retain editable anchors and handles.
- Chinese and English interface.
