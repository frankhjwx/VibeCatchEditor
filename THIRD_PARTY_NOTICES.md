# Third-party dependencies

The application uses the following NuGet packages, pinned by project files and `packages.lock.json`:

| Package | Version | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Vortice.Direct3D11 / Direct2D1 / DXGI / DirectX | 3.6.2 | MIT |
| Vortice.Mathematics | 1.9.2 | MIT |
| SharpGen.Runtime / SharpGen.Runtime.COM | 2.2.0-beta | MIT |
| NAudio.Core / NAudio.WinMM / NAudio.Wasapi | 2.2.1 | MIT |
| NAudio.Vorbis | 1.5.0 | MIT |
| NVorbis | 0.10.4 | MIT |

Package metadata is available in the restored package `.nuspec` files under `artifacts/packages`. The application uses the installed .NET 8 runtime; it is not bundled in the build. Audio source references and limits are recorded in [Audio/REFERENCE.md](src/VibeCatchEditor.App/Audio/REFERENCE.md); licence texts in `Audio/Licenses` are copied to builds.

Source and notices: [Vortice.Windows](https://github.com/amerkoleci/Vortice.Windows), [Vortice.Mathematics](https://github.com/amerkoleci/Vortice.Mathematics), [SharpGenTools](https://github.com/SharpGenTools/SharpGenTools).

The editor owns its models, curve editing and transactions. Catch conversion and gameplay calculations adapt MIT-licensed osu!lazer algorithms; the original osu!framework host and drawable classes are not bundled.

## Catch algorithms and display calculations

The AR/preempt and field geometry calculations refer to ppy/osu commit `48c4800e3ae4ee752452cdff83bd3787ccf3105f`: `osu.Game.Rulesets.Catch/Objects/CatchHitObject.cs`, `osu.Game/Beatmaps/IBeatmapDifficultyInfo.cs`, and `osu.Game.Rulesets.Catch/UI/CatchPlayfieldAdjustmentContainer.cs`. The original framework and UI classes are not bundled. See docs/CATCH_RENDERING.md for calculation boundaries.

All osu! references below use that same commit of [ppy/osu](https://github.com/ppy/osu/tree/48c4800e3ae4ee752452cdff83bd3787ccf3105f):

- `src/VibeCatchEditor.Core/Conversion`: slider events, legacy RNG and Catch stream conversion adapted from `SliderEventGenerator.cs`, `JuiceStream.cs`, `JuiceStreamPath.cs`, `SliderPath.cs`, `LegacyRulesetExtensions.cs`, `LegacyRandom.cs`, `CatchBeatmapProcessor.cs` and `CatchBeatmap.cs`. Full source paths and boundaries: [UPSTREAM.md](src/VibeCatchEditor.Core/Conversion/UPSTREAM.md); MIT text retained in `LICENCE.osu.txt`.
- `src/VibeCatchEditor.Core/Gameplay`: Catch size and hyperdash rules from `osu.Game/Rulesets/Objects/Legacy/LegacyRulesetExtensions.cs`, `osu.Game.Rulesets.Catch/UI/Catcher.cs`, and `osu.Game.Rulesets.Catch/Beatmaps/CatchBeatmapProcessor.cs`; MIT text retained in `LICENSE.osu.txt`.
- `src/VibeCatchEditor.App/Skinning`: texture selection, density, crop and scale rules from legacy Catch skin pieces, `Fruit.cs`, `DrawableTinyDroplet.cs`, `LegacySkin.cs` and `LegacySkinExtensions.cs`. Full source paths: [REFERENCE.md](src/VibeCatchEditor.App/Skinning/REFERENCE.md).

The following MIT notice applies to the adapted osu! source portions, not to independently licensed skin artwork.

Imported Bezier, perfect-circle and Catmull path approximation also adapts `osu.Framework/Utils/PathApproximator.cs` and `CircularArcProperties.cs` from [ppy/osu-framework commit e01524d1492885d8b00ac88b38e7963d76d7d454](https://github.com/ppy/osu-framework/tree/e01524d1492885d8b00ac88b38e7963d76d7d454). Its separate MIT notice is retained in `src/VibeCatchEditor.Core/Conversion/LICENCE.osu-framework.txt`. The framework runtime is not bundled.

## User-supplied skin assets

No default skin artwork is distributed in this repository. `assets/skins/default.osk` is an optional, Git-ignored local archive; when present, it is copied to local build outputs. Local development uses the user-supplied `osu! Default Skin Template (20210821).osk`. Artwork rights remain with their respective owners. Permission to use an archive locally is not a grant to publicly redistribute the artwork; confirm the applicable resource licence before distributing a build containing it. Without a skin, the editor uses geometric fallback rendering. Importing an `.osk` never executes its contents.

## macOS host dependencies

The separate `VibeCatchEditor.Mac` project uses Avalonia 11.3.7 (MIT;
Copyright 2013–2025 The AvaloniaUI Project), MicroCom.Runtime 0.11.0 (MIT;
Copyright 2021 Nikita Tsukanov), SkiaSharp 2.88.9 and HarfBuzzSharp 8.3.1.1.
The complete dependency versions and integrity hashes are in its `packages.lock.json`.
License texts and Skia/HarfBuzz third-party notices are in
`src/VibeCatchEditor.Mac/Licenses` and are copied into the application bundle.
Avalonia source version: `0834dbbbb9252406b08f2e74e8f328cc5ba502ee`.
No Avalonia source files were copied into the editor.

OGG decoding reuses NVorbis 0.10.4 under the existing license above.
`Native/Audio.m` is project-owned glue to the system AVFoundation framework.
The self-contained local bundle also includes Microsoft's .NET runtime and its
bundled license and third-party notices. Local ad-hoc signing is not Developer ID
signing or notarization.
